# Meridian go-to-market: World Routes 2026 and the launch after it

19 September 2026. THE UMBRELLA. One place for the strategy, the decisions, the two milestones,
the integrated timeline and the pre-mortem, so nothing is overlooked that bites at the show.
The detail lives in two companions and this document points at them rather than repeating them:

- `HANDOVER-ROUTES-19Sep2026.md`: engineering and the stand flow (speed, caches, pre-warm by
  airport, request queue and email, stand mode, laptop build, Plan A/B).
- `ROUTES-COMMERCIAL-PLAN-19Sep2026.md`: sales funnel, deck and pack and imagery, host manual,
  pricing structure, leads and feedback, website, marketing calendar, meetings, competitors.
- `PROMPT-for-Fable-Routes-19Sep2026.txt`: how a new chat picks either track up.
- `MASTER-TASK-LIST.md`: everything else open.

## Status

Rewritten every session by the programme controller; John reads this on a phone. Session 1,
19 September 2026, 16:00. Clone: DevPC `C:\AviaDev`, HEAD `11a4c3f` (aircraft-econ code committed and pushed 19 Sep,
confirmed by John's paste).

| WS | State | Evidence | Next action | Owner | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| W1 Speed and caches | In progress | No timing exists yet; probe `diag_routes_timing.py` written 19 Sep, commit block issued | John runs the timing block on the workstation and pastes it | John / controller | 23 Sep |
| W2 Stand flow | Not started | Queue and email design not yet put to John | Design on one screen to John (step E); laptop build proof | Controller / John | Design 22 Sep; laptop 1 Oct |
| W3 Presentation | Not started | Old 2 July pptx only | Deck v1 after messaging settles | Controller, Jol, Nick | 3 Oct |
| W4 Host | Not started | Host's name and contact in no document | Manual v1; get host details from John | Controller / John | 10 Oct |
| W5 Leads, feedback, order-ready | Blocked on John | Lead store and email sender undecided | Decisions batch (step C) | John | 25 Sep |
| W6 Messaging, marketing, website, meetings | In progress | Four sentences drafted this session (step C) | John and Jol settle; invitations out | John, Jol | Final 25 Sep; invites 26-29 Sep |
| W7 Rehearsal and freeze | Not started | Freeze 10 Oct, Boeing 13 Oct in the calendar | Nothing until W1 and W2 exist | Controller | 10 Oct |

**Found this session, not in any document:**
- The 29 August aircraft-economics CODE is uncommitted on the DevPC: `9cb5ed1` carries the CSV
  only; `aircraft_econ_loader.py`, `test_aircraft_econ_table.py` and the edits to
  `aircraft_economics.py`, `config.py`, `cortex_app.py` (`/api/aircraft`, fallback list
  removed) are modified or untracked. Master list "Closed 29 Aug" and item 1.1 are wrong as
  written; the workstation, if it pulled, has a table with no loader.
- `app/preagg.duckdb.tmp` on the DevPC holds 24GB of DuckDB temp from a 5 July build that did
  not finish (the 16GB box); `app/preagg.duckdb` (77MB, 5 July) is of unknown state. Treat no
  preagg store as existing; build on the workstation (step D). The 24GB is deletable.
- Estate index v11 (8 Aug) still says "World Routes early October"; the umbrella governs.
- Master list 2.4 (does the 89/82 claim describe the engine the client sees) is still open;
  the standing accuracy wording is fixed regardless, and pre-mortem 9 depends on it.
- Working tree also carries an uncommitted +58 lines on HANDOVER-23Aug2026.md and three
  binary test outputs (master list 5.10).
- The preagg store is NOT reachable from the live app: `cortex_app.py` and `config.py` carry no
  preagg hook; only `backtest.py --preagg` and `route_feed.py` (`feed_cfg["preagg"]`) know it.
  "Switch it on" (handover 3.2) therefore needs a small wiring change on the demo path before
  the freeze, after the identity check passes. `sector_adj` is optional by design; the core
  tables are `od_p2p` and `od_single`.
- No stage timing exists in the run path (only job-level `elapsed_s`), so measurement is
  from outside: `diag_routes_timing.py` (HTTP wall clock in stand order, plus an in-process
  cProfile mode for attribution). Evidence files: `TIMING-<date>.md` at repo root.

## Decisions log

- 19 Sep 2026: the six decisions in section 1 (licence in hand for the show; soft price with
  expiring launch discount; two milestones; messaging before invitations; no competitor
  approaches; Optimise demonstrated on the stand).
- 19 Sep 2026: programme controller appointed; this Status block is the single truth.
- 19 Sep 2026: the uncommitted 29 August aircraft-economics code is COMMITTED before the
  freeze (John: it was a fix that emerged after he left for holiday and was held back so it
  could not break anything while he was away). Commit block issued; one live check on the
  workstation owed before 10 Oct.
- 19 Sep 2026: the 24GB `app/preagg.duckdb.tmp` on the DevPC is checked for duplication
  before removal, not removed on suspicion (John). Check block issued.
- 19 Sep 2026: check done. DevPC `preagg.duckdb` holds `od_p2p` (1,157,577 rows) and
  `od_single` (5,780,022 rows) and NO `sector_adj`: the 5 July build died on the heavy
  sector table and the 24GB is its spill. Removal block issued; the Routes store is built on
  the workstation with raised memory and a local temp dir.

## Waiting on John

1. CLOSED 19 Sep: HEAD `11a4c3f` confirmed and pushed.
2. CLOSED 19 Sep: aircraft-econ code committed at `11a4c3f`. Live check on the workstation
   still owed before 10 Oct (master list 6.6).
3. **The timing block (step B)**: issued 19 Sep. Commit the probe on the DevPC, pull on the
   workstation, restart the server, run it, paste the table. If not by 23 Sep: W1 cannot start, the 21 Oct speed acceptance is at risk
   from day one, and the stand plan is written on the Plan B assumption (pre-rendered panel,
   pitches queued for the evening).
4. **Stand host's name, contact and start date; the stand number.** In no document. Needed
   for W4 and for the Cloudflare Access policy (pre-mortem 7).
5. Decisions batch of this week (pricing numbers, meeting targets, email sender, lead store,
   attending-airport list source): sent separately as step C.

## 1. Decisions taken 19 September (John)

1. **Licence position**: OAG and Sabre have both confirmed on calls, with multiple witnesses,
   that Avia may use the tool at Routes and share its outputs. Written confirmation is being
   chased. Notification obligations are met. Status: IN HAND for the show; the letter remains a
   gate for the first paid contract, not for Routes.
2. **Pricing approach**: SAY A SOFT NUMBER. An expected list price, stated as soft, plus a
   written year-1 launch-customer discount that visibly expires, for a stated small number of
   places. Not silent testing: budget holders with calendar-year money cannot act on "still
   deciding", and the reaction to a real figure is the only pricing feedback worth having. List
   is refined after Routes from that reaction. The numbers themselves come from the pricing
   chat and go in the follow-up one-pager, never on the stand unprompted; if asked, the host
   gives the expected range and the launch offer in one sentence.
3. **Two milestones, not one**: DEMO-READY 21 October (the stand); ORDER-READY 7 November (an
   airport with budget to use this calendar year can sign and be onboarded). Order-ready is a
   checklist (section 3), not a rebuild, and it is where the Routes follow-ups land.
4. **Messaging gates the meetings**: invitations go 26-29 September, after the message is
   settled (section 4). Late requests at Routes are rarely honoured, so the message comes first
   this week.
5. **Competitors**: no comparison approaches to a competitor's clients before launch; know
   their positioning cold; nothing about them in any material (commercial plan, section 10).
6. **Optimise on the stand**: demonstrated for the interested, it is the USP; Run for
   everyone; the researched pitch explained with examples and queued on departure (handover,
   3.7 and 4.1).

---

## 2. The strategy in one paragraph

Leave Routes with named, qualified people who ran their own route live on the stand, hold a
pack with their numbers in their inbox, and have agreed a follow-up. Convert three to five of
them into year-1 launch customers by 7 November on a soft list price with a written, expiring
discount, host them on per-client access while the full product hardens, and use their feedback
and references to set list price and launch properly in the new year. The stand starts sales;
the 48-hour follow-up and the order-ready checklist close them.

---

## 3. Order-ready by 7 November: the checklist

What has to be true for the first paying client to sign, be onboarded and be supported. None of
it is the full user model; all of it is achievable in the three weeks after Routes.

- Per-client Cloudflare Access policy (their email domain) and a unique password per client;
  the shared tester password retired for paying clients.
- Usage attribution per client in the R9 log, from the Access identity, not the Basic-auth
  username (master list 1.5).
- A two-page agreement: scope (users, routes per month, packs, review call), term and price,
  year-1 discount and its expiry, the economics disclaimer as already written in the tool, the
  licence position stated, no liability for decisions taken on outputs, data handling (Avia
  stores no client data; outputs only).
- Invoice template and payment terms; a support address that a named person reads daily; an
  onboarding call script (45 minutes: their first three routes, together).
- The licence letters from OAG and Sabre, or a documented record of the verbal confirmations
  (date, participants, what was said) held on Egnyte until the letters arrive.
- The known-issues list current, sent with onboarding: day-of-week, fare, the new aircraft
  types' economics, and anything Routes exposes. A client who is told is a beta client; one who
  finds out is a lost one.
- Monitoring and a restart procedure for the workstation and tunnel, with an alert to John's
  phone (handover, section 5).

## 4. Messaging, settled this week (John, Jol; a Fable chat drafts)

Four sentences everything else hangs off. Draft by 23 September, final by 25 September, then
the invitations go.

- The one-liner: run your route forecast on the stand, in seconds, built on 25 years of QSI
  practice and calibrated against real launches.
- Three sub-messages: the time-of-day optimisation (the USP); the researched pack in your
  inbox in 30 minutes; independent, senior, no house view to sell.
- The offer, in one sentence: expected list price (soft), launch customers this year at a
  stated year-1 discount, a stated number of places.
- The accuracy line, exactly as ruled: calibrated leads (89% within 20%, 82% within 10% on
  2,915 launches), blind evidence as portfolios only.

## 6. Pre-mortem: what bites at the show, and the answer to each

Written as if it happened. Each has an owner and a mitigation already in the plans.

1. **The wired connection fails on the morning of day one.** Answer: 5G router primary, venue
   secondary, laptop build proven by 1 October (handover 4.1a, 4.5). If the laptop build is not
   proven, the stand runs the panel's pre-rendered packs and the queue goes out that night.
2. **A visitor's airport is not in the stores, or the run returns something silly.** Small
   airports with thin Sabre coverage, or a route beyond every type's range. Answer: the host's
   line ("the data is thin for that market; let me show you a neighbour and we will run yours
   properly and send it"); the request form captures it; the pack is checked by a person before
   it is sent for any route the engine flagged. Pre-warm by airport will surface most of these
   before the show; the attending-airport list is the test set.
3. **The forecast contradicts the visitor's own numbers.** Answer: this is the product working.
   The host says so: "a gap is informative; which side do you think is right, and why", captures
   the reason, and the follow-up is exactly that conversation. Nick's methodology note is the
   backing. Never defend a number on the stand; ask about the gap.
4. **A competitor's client, or the competitor, tests the host.** Answer: commercial plan 10;
   the one honest sentence; no comparison; capture what they say.
5. **The host quotes a price, or a feature that is not in the build.** Answer: the manual's
   "what not to say" page and the training; the soft price and launch offer as a single
   rehearsed sentence; the known-issues list in the host's pocket.
6. **A pack fails to send, or sends with a wrong figure.** Answer: the queue view on the stand
   shows failures; every pack is the one-run definition; a person eyeballs any flagged route
   before send; the sender domain and SPF/DKIM are tested on 13 October, not 21 October.
7. **Cloudflare Access blocks the stand laptop or the host.** Answer: both added to the policy
   and tested on 13 October; the public landing page needs no Access.
8. **Lead consent and GDPR.** Answer: the consent tick on the form, the privacy line on the
   card, the lead store on Avia's own infrastructure, exported to Egnyte, nothing to a third
   party without a decision.
9. **The accuracy claim is challenged by someone who knows the field.** Answer: the ruling is
   the answer: calibrated leads, blind as portfolios, never a single-route blind figure; the
   host does not go beyond it and offers John.
10. **John is not on the stand when the buyer is.** Answer: the host's brief includes when John
    is on the stand; the request form books a follow-up slot; the deck and pack carry John's
    contact; the five pre-arranged meetings are John's.
11. **The workstation restarts and loses every pre-warmed route.** Answer: the persistent cache
    (handover 3.3) is the whole point; proven across a restart before freeze.
12. **Boeing on 13 October and Routes need different things.** Answer: they do not; Boeing runs
    the Routes flow exactly, and anything Boeing wants beyond it is post-Routes.
13. **The licence letter has not arrived.** Answer: the verbal confirmations are recorded with
    date and participants on Egnyte; the show proceeds; the letter gates the first contract.
14. **A visitor wants to sign on the stand.** Answer: take the details, thank them, and tell
    them the truth: onboarding opens 7 November and they are first in the queue. A signature
    taken before order-ready is a support problem, not a sale.

---

## 7. Who owns what, in one line each

John: decisions, messaging sign-off, meetings, Boeing, host training, follow-ups, pricing.
Jol: copy (website, one-pager, posts), deck review, dry-run sceptic, feedback card.
Nick: methodology consistency across note, deck, pack; second eyes on panel outputs.
Jess: Atlas on the same stand, same freeze, same rehearsal.
Fable chats: everything in the prompt's two tracks; this document kept current.
Stand host: the demo, the form, the manual; nothing else.
